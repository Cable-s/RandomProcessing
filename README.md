# RandomProcessingProjects
A repo for random small processing projects I work on

Fourier_Series - fourier series up to 6 circles, showing how to get closer to a square wave if you have infinite of them.

Fourier_Series_draw_line - created a tool to draw any picture with fourier series. you can create your own drawing by adding the magnitude, frequency, and starting angle of each vector in the "info.txt". still pretty crude

Monty_Hall - The Monty Hall problem, there are 2 files. Monty_Hall.pde allows you to play the game from the                              console. Monty_Hall_Auto.pde will automatically play              and graph the wins : total on a pie chart, it'll always switch

Moon_Phases - a basic looking simulation of how the moon phases are seen from earth as it revolves around the earth

Physics_Vectors - a program that allows you to draw lines (vectors), and then add them all up to get the resultant vector.

RandomPi - I calculate Pi from random numbers using the probility that two random numbers being corpime equaling 6 / PI^2

Ray_Marching - Ray Marching formula to draw circles and square that are placed randomly in an envirnment from a top down view (thanks coding train)

Sierpinski_Square - Works the same as the triangle, but with 4 verticies and you have to make sure it can't pick the same vertex twice in a row.

Sierpinski_triangle - Saw a video on instagram saying that if you take a random point in a triangle and draw another point to one of the vertices of the triangle and iterate it where each points goes half way to another vertex. you'll get the Sierpinski triangle and lo and behold.

Sound_Blocks - blocks that move back and forth at different rates, and play sounds when they bounce

Terrain_Generator - 2D terrain generator using perlin noise to move a line up or down and left or right at each point

sketch_2DicePlot - Rolling 2 dice, adding the rolls, and plotting the results on a graph to see which is the most common number when rolling said two dice
